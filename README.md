# EagleParkApp

EaglePark is an iOS application built with SwiftUI that allows students throughout the Boston area to rent and find open parking spots. The app provides Firebase Authentication for secure logins along with features for creating place markers from addresses and filtering nearby spots that update dynamically through a MapKit-based listings overview.

# Key Techniques Used

# Next Steps

Next steps will be to allow for more user interaction. This will be done by implementing features such as university email verification, user-to-user messaging, payment integration, reservation scheduling, and a review system. Other UI polish, map clustering, and onboarding flow improvements will help to ready EaglePark for public testing and/or App Store submission.
