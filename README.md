# EagleParkApp

EaglePark is an iOS app written in SwiftUI. The app solves a very real, day-to-day problem: finding and securing reliable, nearby parking in a city where the college population is dense.

I became interested in the project because parking on Boston area college campuses was so incredibly fragmented and driven by informal social connections. Students were forced to reserve spots via group chats or ad hoc word of mouth. I wanted to make the process more formal and accessible.

Approaching EaglePark, I had a product oriented mind-set. From the start, it should be simple for a user to post as well as browse nearby spots. As a user, that meant a secure authentication process, easy-to-understand location visibility, and simplified filtering that made it possible to surface just the right spots for a given student’s needs. I wrote the app to support this experience from end to end, with account creation through browsing listings on a live map.

EaglePark is from a business and growth angle a two sided marketplace. I prioritized creating as little friction as possible for each side, making it easy to post a listing from an address, see demand as it happens in real time, and have the most relevant options show based on location proximity. Thinking through this helped me with other questions around trust, onboarding, and communicating value to first time users.

# Key Techniques Used

Cloud Firestore Integration, 
Firebase Authentication, 
MVVM Architecture, 
MapKit + Custom Annotations, 
CLGeocoder, 
Dynamic Filtering & Sorting, 
JSON Decoding

# Next Steps

Next steps will be to allow for more user interaction. This will be done by implementing features such as university email verification, user-to-user messaging, payment integration, reservation scheduling, and a review system. Other UI polish, map clustering, and onboarding flow improvements will help to ready EaglePark for public testing and/or App Store submission.
